# JXMapViewer2 2.9.0

![image](https://github.com/NeuralCortex/JXMapViewer2/blob/main/images/app.png)

This project is based on JXMapViewer2, which you can find [here](https://github.com/msteiger/jxmapviewer2). I decided not to create a fork
because I don't use IntelliJ. Since the original project has not been maintained for a long time, it was necessary to make some adjustments.

New features:

1. Apache NetBeans 27 Maven project
2. Support for Java version 24
3. Modern logger (Log4J 2)
4. Examples are now integrated (easy to extend)
5. Proxy support - with and without authentication (must be tested by you)
6. Performance improvement
7. Modern icons
8. OSM Tile Server Response 301 fix (the original library no longer worked because of this)
