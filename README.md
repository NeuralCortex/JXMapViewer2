## Overview

This project is an enhanced version of JXMapViewer2, originally developed by [msteiger](https://github.com/msteiger/jxmapviewer2). Instead of forking the original repository, this version was created as a standalone project due to differences in development environments (IntelliJ was not used). As the original JXMapViewer2 has not been maintained, this version introduces several updates and improvements to ensure compatibility and enhance functionality.

## Features

- Built as a Maven project in Apache NetBeans 27.
- Supports Java 24.
- Uses modern logging with Log4j 2.
- Includes integrated examples for easy extension.
- Adds proxy support (with and without authentication; requires user testing).
- Improves performance over the original library.
- Updates icons to modern designs.
- Fixes the OSM Tile Server Response 301 issue, which caused the original library to stop functioning.
